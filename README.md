# thesis

## ⚠️ This repo has moved

**All seeds and thesis content have been consolidated into [unpack](https://github.com/mordechaipotash/unpack).**

The `thesis.json` file here still works, but for the latest seeds and documentation, go to:

→ **[github.com/mordechaipotash/unpack](https://github.com/mordechaipotash/unpack)**

---

## Why the move?

The Bottleneck Principle in action:
- **Before:** Multiple repos (thesis, seedgarden, unpack) with overlapping content
- **After:** One clear entry point with all seeds

---

## Quick Start (still works)

```
1. Copy thesis.json
2. Paste into any LLM
3. Type "unpack"
```

Or use the consolidated repo: **[unpack](https://github.com/mordechaipotash/unpack)**
